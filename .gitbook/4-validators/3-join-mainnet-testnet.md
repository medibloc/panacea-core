# Join the Network

This tutorial introduces deploying a new node on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and join the Panacea Mainnet.


## Launch an AWS EC2 Instance

### Choose an AMI

Choose Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS 64-bit (x86) with SSD Volume Type.

![](images/ec2-ami.png)

### Choose the instance type

Choose the `m5.large` instance type (minimum spec).

![](images/ec2-instance-type.png)

### Configure instance details

Configuration | Value
--------------|-------
Network | Choose an existing VPC or default one if you don't have any
Subnet | Choose an existing subnet or default one if you don't have any
Auto-assign Public IP | Enable only if you access a full node from the outside of its VPC
Other fields | Follow default settings

### Add a storage

Configuration | Value
--------------|-------
Size | 500 GiB
Volume Type | `General Purpose SSD (gp3)`
IOPS | 3000
Throughput | 125 MB/s

### Configure a Security Group

Type | Protocol | Port range |  Description
-----|----------|------------|-------------
SSH | TCP | 22 |
Custom TCP | TCP | 26656 | P2P with other nodes
Custom TCP | TCP | 26657 | RPC
Custom TCP | TCP | 1317 | REST API

The P2P `26656` port must be exposed to other Panacea nodes.
If your node will be in the VPC guarded by Sentry nodes, expose `26656` to only Sentry nodes (recommended).
If not, expose it to anywhere.
For details about Sentry nodes, please see the [Tendermint guide](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/nodes/validators.html#local-configuration).

The RPC `26657` and REST API `1317` ports are for sending transactions/queries to your node.
So, expose them to the network where you perform operational actions.


### Connect to your EC2 instance and install prerequisites.

```bash
ssh ubuntu@<your-ec2-ip> -i <your-key>.pem
```

Install prerequisites by following the [Installation](1-cli-installation.md) guide.


## Setup a New Node

These instructions are for setting up a brand new full node from scratch.

First, initialize the node and create the necessary config files:

```bash
panacead init <your_custom_moniker>
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
The `moniker` can contains only ASCII characters. Using Unicode characters will render your node unreachable.
{% endhint %}

Then, modify the `timeout_commit` in the `~/.panacea/config/config.toml` as below.
```toml
[consensus]

timeout_commit = "5s"
```

After that, edit the `~/.panacea/config/app.toml` file in order to enable the anti-spam mechanism and reject incoming transactions with less than the `minimum-gas-prices`:
```toml
# Validators reject any tx from the mempool with less than the minimum-gas-prices.
minimum-gas-prices = "5umed"

# NOTE: For the Testnet, please set minimum-gas-prices as "", so that no fee is required.
```

Now, your full node has been initialized!

### Copy the Genesis file

Fetch the `genesis.json` file of the latest chain from the following links, and place it to `~/.panacea/config/genesis.json`.
- Mainnet: https://github.com/medibloc/panacea-mainnet
- Testnet: https://github.com/medibloc/panacea-testnet

### Configure Persistent Peers

MediBloc is not operating seed nodes, but will provide them in near future.

Until then, please use public full nodes provided by MediBloc.
- Mainnet: https://github.com/medibloc/panacea-mainnet#persistent-peers
- Testnet: https://github.com/medibloc/panacea-testnet#persistent-peers

Insert those public nodes to the `persistent_peers` field in the `~/.panacea/config/config.toml`.

For more information on seeds and peers, see the [Using Tendermint: Peers](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/tendermint-core/using-tendermint.html#peers).

### State Sync

Your node can rapidly sync with the network using state sync without replaying historical blocks. For more details, please refer to [this](https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.34/tendermint-core/state-sync.html).

To set state sync enabled, RPC servers and trusted block info (height and hash) are required.

You can use the following public RPC endpoints provided by MediBloc team.
- 15.165.191.68:26657
- 54.254.66.59:26657

trusted block info can be obtained via RPC.

```shell
curl -s 15.165.191.68:26657/block | jq -r '.result.block.header.height + "\n" + .result.block_id.hash'
# 7700000 (height)
# 0D3E53F02ABCDDA8AAC1520342D37A290DDABE4C28190EE6E2C6B0C819F74D4A (hash)
```

Then, you need to edit several things in `~/.panacea/config/config.toml` file.

```toml
# The nodes that are providing statesync must be registered as persistent_peers.
persistent_peers = "28ca0dffec0b97655c711c09889929e7c3a839a7@15.165.191.68:26656,c455619f4ffe67a9578e208f0b9121748e36d504@54.254.66.59:26656"

[statesync]

enable = true

rpc_servers = "15.165.191.68:26657,54.254.66.59:26657" # rpc addresses
trust_height = <trusted-block-height>
trust_hash = "<trusted-block-hash>"
trust_period = "336h0m0s" # 2/3 of 21 days (unbonding period)
```

If your node has block history data previously synced, you need to clear the database of your node first.

{% hint style="danger" %}
The `unsafe-reset-all` command will erase your node database. If you are running a validator node, be sure you backed up the following files, prior to running the `unsafe-reset-all` command.
- `~/.panacea/data/priv_validator_state.json`
- `~/.panacea/config/priv_validator_key.json`
- `~/.panacea/config/node_key.json`

And, restore these files after `unsafe-reset-all` to avoid potential double signing.
{% endhint %}

```shell
panacead tendermint unsafe-reset-all
```

## Run a Full Node

### Before Running a Node
Before running full node, it is highly recommended to use [state sync](#state-sync).

It is possible to start from scratch but will take a significant amount of time and effort to catch up.
To sync full node from scratch, it is important to note that you must start with v2.0.1 and proceed through several upgrades at proper block heights.

Another way is to use a snapshot to recover up to the latest block. 
We do not currently have an official snapshot download service, so please request a snapshot from the Panacea team or another full node operator.

For bootstrapping full node, state sync would be sufficient.

### Launch Node
Start the full node with this command:

```bash
panacead start
```

Check that everything is running smoothly:

```bash
panacead status
```

In production, it is recommended to run the process in background by following the guide below.

### Background Process

To run the node in a background process with automatic restarts, you can use a service manager like [systemd](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/systemd).
This is more reliable way to run a background process in the long term.
To set this up, run the following:
```bash
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/panacead.service > /dev/null <<EOF  
[Unit]
Description=Panacea Daemon
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=$USER
ExecStart=$(which panacead) start
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=4096

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
```

It is very important to set the `LimitNOFILE=4096` since Panacea opens many DB files.

If you're using Cosmovisor, add the following environment variables after the `LimitNOFILE` line and replace `$(which panacead)` with `$(which cosmovisor)`.
```
Environment="DAEMON_HOME=$HOME/.panacea"
Environment="DAEMON_NAME=panacead"
Environment="DAEMON_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES=false"
Environment="DAEMON_RESTART_AFTER_UPGRADE=true"
```
For more details about those environment variables, please see the [Cosmovisor guide](4-cosmovisor.md).

Then, setup the daemon.
```bash
sudo -S systemctl daemon-reload
sudo -S systemctl enable panacead  # the process will be started automatically whenever your system is booted.
```

You can then start the process and confirm that it is running.
```bash
sudo -S systemctl start panacead
sudo service panacead status

sudo journalctl -u panacead -f --output cat   # See logs from panacead
```

## Monitor the chain using block explorers

## Join as a validator

If you want to participate in validating blocks as a validator,
you can register yourself into the validator set by submitting a transaction.

For more details, see the [CLI guide: Create your validator](interaction-with-the-network-cli.md#create-your-validator).

If you already joined as a validator and if you want to modify your validator details, please see the [CLI guide: Edit validator description](interaction-with-the-network-cli.md#edit-validator-description).
