# DEP and the problems it solves

DEP seeks to address the problems of decentralized data delivery that allows for data validation while ensuring data privacy:

- Data privacy
- Data validation
- Incentive
- Decentralization
- Scalability

## Data privacy

DEP uses data encryption in all data delivery processes to ensure the privacy of sensitive data. 
Symmetric and asymmetric key encryption is utilized to ensure that the privacy of data during all data delivery processes.

## Data Validation

As a data consumer, it is essential to verify that the data you receive is the right data.
DEP provides a way to verify data by utilizing oracle running in an enclave environment, did-based verifiable credentials, and verifiable presentation.

## Incentive

By providing data, the data provider can be rewarded with an incentive offered by the data consumer. 
In this case, the delivery of data and the incentive must be processed atomically and simultaneously. 
DEP ensures this through the panacea blockchain Tx.

## Decentralization

The DEP components, panacea blockchain and oracle, are open decentralized ecosystem where everyone can participate.
Oracle, which plays a central role in data verification, can be run in the enclave environment by anyone and can participate through the oracle registration process.
As a data verifier in the ecosystem, oracle can also get a certain percentage of incentives, so a healthy ecosystem can be organized.

## Scalability

The DEP has a scalable structure that allows the validation process to be divided among the oracles as the number of operating oracles increases.
Since oracles play a direct role in data validation and are not involved in blockchain consensus, the number of oracles can improve overall DEP performance.
