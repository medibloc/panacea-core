# Interaction with the network: CLIâ€Œ

## Panacea CLI

For more information on the command usage, refer to its help screen: `panaceacli --help`.

Here is a list of useful `panaceacli` commands, including usage examples.

### Keys

#### Key Types

There are three types of key representations that are used:

* `panacea`
  * Derived from account keys generated by `panaceacli keys add`
  * Used to receive funds
  * e.g. `panacea17kmacx3czkdnhtfueqzzxk9xqzapj453f23m5a`
* `panaceavaloper`
  * Used to associate a validator to it's operator
  * Used to invoke staking commands
  * e.g. `panaceavaloper17kmacx3czkdnhtfueqzzxk9xqzapj453wg3mgr`
* `panaceapub`
  * Derived from account keys generated by `panaceacli keys add`
  * e.g. `panaceapub1addwnpepqwk3j2j3knuyah89skh8wtn5kr4qx32nhql6hzjadzmre2xlfmvxgy39ln8`
* `panaceavalconspub`
  * Generated when the node is created with `panacead init`.
  * Get this value with `panacead tendermint show-validator`
  * e.g. `panaceavalconspub1zcjduepqktkqqsl9rchj77v9vg0crc87grp9h2u5ggpdtvcq74kxlr29lgwsa3dr66`

#### Generate Keys

You'll need an account private and public key pair \(a.k.a. `sk, pk` respectively\) to be able to receive funds, send txs, bond tx, etc.

To generate a new _secp256k1_ key:

```bash
panaceacli keys add <account_name>
```

Next, you will have to create a passphrase to protect the key on disk. The output of the above command will contain a _seed phrase_. It is recommended to save the _seed phrase_ in a safe place so that in case you forget the password, you could eventually regenerate the key from the seed phrase with the following command:

```bash
panaceacli keys add --recover
```

If you check your private keys, you'll now see `<account_name>`:

```bash
panaceacli keys show <account_name>
```

View the validator operator's address via:

```text
panaceacli keys show <account_name> --bech=val
```

You can see all your available keys by typing:

```bash
panaceacli keys list
```

View the validator pubkey for your node by typing:

```bash
panacead tendermint show-validator
```

Note that this is the Tendermint signing key, _not_ the operator key you will use in delegation transactions.

::: danger Warning We strongly recommend _NOT_ using the same passphrase for multiple keys. The MediBloc team will not be responsible for the loss of funds. :::

### Fees & Gas

Each transaction may either supply fees or gas prices, but not both. Most users will typically provide fees as this is the cost you will end up incurring for the transaction being included in the ledger.

Validator's have a minimum gas price configuration and they use this value when determining if they should include the transaction in a block during `CheckTx`, where `gasPrices >= minGasPrices`. Note, your transaction must supply fees that are greater than or equal to minimum fee which the validator requires.

**Note**: With such a mechanism in place, validators may start to prioritize txs by `gasPrice` in the mempool, so providing higher fees or gas prices may yield higher tx priority.

e.g.

```bash
panaceacli tx send ... --fees=1000000umed
```

or

```bash
panaceacli tx send ... --gas-prices=500.0umed
```

### Account

#### Query Account balance

After receiving tokens to your address, you can view your account's balance by typing:

```bash
panaceacli query account <account_panacea>
```

::: warning Note When you query an account balance with zero tokens, you will get this error: `account <account_panacea> does not exist.` This can also happen if you fund the account before your node has fully synced with the chain. These are both normal.:::

### Send Tokens

The following command could be used to send coins from one account to another:

```bash
panaceacli tx send \
  --to <destination_panacea> \
  --coins 10000000umed \
  --chain-id=<chain_id> \
  --from=<key_name> \
```

where `destination_panacea` is a key matching the format: `panacea1y3mhszahwatjc3023datq46a0u2fv337tes4n9`

::: warning Note The `--amount` flag accepts the format `--amount=<value|coin_name>`. :::

::: tip Note You may want to cap the maximum gas that can be consumed by the transaction via the `--gas` flag. If you pass `--gas=auto`, the gas supply will be automatically estimated before executing the transaction. Gas estimate might be inaccurate as state changes could occur in between the end of the simulation and the actual execution of a transaction, thus an adjustment is applied on top of the original estimate in order to ensure the transaction is broadcasted successfully. The adjustment can be controlled via the `--gas-adjustment` flag, whose default value is 1.0. :::

Now, view the updated balances of the origin and destination accounts:

```bash
panaceacli query account <account_panacea>
panaceacli query account <destination_panacea>
```

You can also check your balance at a given block by using the `--block` flag:

```bash
panaceacli query account <account_panacea> --block=<block_height>
```

You can simulate a transaction without actually broadcasting it by appending the `--dry-run` flag to the command line:

```bash
panaceacli tx send \
  --to <destination_panacea> \
  --coins 10000000umed \
  --chain-id=<chain_id> \
  --from=<key_name> \
  --dry-run
```

Furthermore, you can build a transaction and print its JSON format to STDOUT by appending `--generate-only` to the list of the command line arguments:

```bash
panaceacli tx send \
  --to <destination_panacea> \ 
  --coins 10000000umed \
  --chain-id=<chain_id> \
  --from=<key_name> \
  --generate-only > unsignedSendTx.json
```

```bash
panaceacli tx sign \
  --chain-id=<chain_id> \
  --from=<key_name> \
  unsignedSendTx.json > signedSendTx.json
```

You can validate the transaction's signatures by typing the following:

```bash
panaceacli tx sign --validate-signatures signedSendTx.json
```

You can broadcast the signed transaction to a node by providing the JSON file to the following command:

```bash
panaceacli tx broadcast --node=<node> signedSendTx.json
```

### Query Transactions

#### Matching a set of tags

You can use the transaction search command to query for transactions that match a specific set of `tags`, which are added on every transaction.

Each tag is conformed by a key-value pair in the form of `<tag>:<value>`. Tags can also be combined to query for a more specific result using the `&` symbol.

The command for querying transactions using a `tag` is the following:

```bash
panaceacli query txs --tags='<tag>:<value>'
```

And for using multiple `tags`:

```bash
panaceacli query txs --tags='<tag1>:<value1>&<tag2>:<value2>'
```

The pagination is supported as well via `page` and `limit`:

```bash
panaceacli query txs --tags='<tag>:<value>' --page=1 --limit=20
```

::: tip Note

The action tag always equals the message type returned by the `Type()` function of the relevant message.

You can find a list of available `tags` on each module by looking at the /tags directory of each module. :::

#### Matching a transaction's hash

You can also query a single transaction by its hash using the following command:

```bash
panaceacli query tx [hash]
```

### Slashing

#### Unjailing

To unjail your jailed validator

```bash
panaceacli tx slashing unjail --from <validator-operator-addr>
```

#### Signing Info

To retrieve a validator's signing info:

```bash
panaceacli query slashing signing-info <validator-pubkey>
```

#### Query Parameters

You can get the current slashing parameters via:

```bash
panaceacli query slashing params
```

### Staking

#### Set up a Validator

&lt;To be announced&gt;

#### Delegate to a Validator

You can delegate `umed` to a validator. These delegators can receive part of the validator's fee revenue.

**Query Validators**

You can query the list of all validators of a specific chain:

```bash
panaceacli query staking validators
```

If you want to get the information of a single validator you can check it with:

```bash
panaceacli query staking validator <account_panaceaval>
```

#### Bond Tokens

Here's how you can bond tokens to a validator \(_i.e._ delegate\):

```bash
panaceacli tx staking delegate \
  <validator address> \
  10000000umed \
  --from=<key_name> \
  --chain-id=<chain_id>
```

`<validator>` is the operator address of the validator to which you intend to delegate. If you are running a local testnet, you can find this with:

```bash
panaceacli keys show [name] --bech val
```

where `[name]` is the name of the key you specified when you initialized `panacead`.

While tokens are bonded, they are pooled with all the other bonded tokens in the network. Validators and delegators obtain a percentage of shares that equal their stake in this pool.

**Query Delegations**

Once submitted a delegation to a validator, you can see it's information by using the following command:

```bash
panaceacli query staking delegation <delegator_addr> <validator_addr>
```

Or if you want to check all your current delegations with distinct validators:

```bash
panaceacli query staking delegations <delegator_addr>
```

You can also get previous delegation\(s\) status by adding the `--height` flag.

#### Unbond Tokens

If for any reason the validator misbehaves, or you just want to unbond a certain amount of tokens, use this following command.

```bash
panaceacli tx staking unbond \
  <account_panaceaval> \
  10000umed \
  --from=<key_name> \
  --chain-id=<chain_id>
```

The unbonding will be automatically completed when the unbonding period has passed.

**Query Unbonding-Delegations**

Once you begin an unbonding-delegation, you can see it's information by using the following command:

```bash
panaceacli query staking unbonding-delegation <delegator_addr> <validator_addr>
```

Or if you want to check all your current unbonding-delegations with disctinct validators:

```bash
panaceacli query staking unbonding-delegations <account_panacea>
```

Additionally, as you can get all the unbonding-delegations from a particular validator:

```bash
panaceacli query staking unbonding-delegations-from <account_panaceaval>
```

To get previous unbonding-delegation\(s\) status on past blocks, try adding the `--height` flag.

#### Redelegate Tokens

A redelegation is a type delegation that allows you to bond illiquid tokens from one validator to another:

```bash
panaceacli tx staking redelegate \
  <src validator address> \
  <dst validator address> \
  10000umed \
  --from=<key_name> \
  --chain-id=<chain_id>
```

The redelegation will be automatically completed when the unbonding period has passed.

**Query Redelegations**

Once you begin an redelegation, you can see it's information by using the following command:

```bash
panaceacli query staking redelegation <delegator_addr> <src_val_addr> <dst_val_addr>
```

Or if you want to check all your current unbonding-delegations with disctinct validators:

```bash
panaceacli query staking redelegations <account_panacea>
```

Additionally, as you can get all the outgoing redelegations from a particular validator:

```bash
panaceacli query staking redelegations-from <account_panaceaval>
```

To get previous redelegation\(s\) status on past blocks, try adding the `--height` flag.

#### Query Parameters

Parameters define high level settings for staking. You can get the current values by using:

```bash
panaceacli query staking params
```

With the above command you will get the values for:

* Unbonding time
* Maximum numbers of validators
* Maximum entries
* Coin denomination for staking

#### Query Pool

A staking `Pool` defines the dynamic parameters of the current state. You can query them with the following command:

```bash
panaceacli query staking pool
```

With the `pool` command you will get the values for:

* Not-bonded and bonded tokens

### Fee Distribution

#### Query distribution parameters

To check the current distribution parameters, run:

```bash
panaceacli query distr params
```

#### Query validator commission

To check the current outstanding commission for a validator, run:

```bash
panaceacli query distr commission <validator_address>
```

#### Query validator slashes

To check historical slashes for a validator, run:

```bash
panaceacli query distr slashes <validator_address> <start_height> <end_height>
```

#### Query delegator rewards

To check current rewards for a delegation \(were they to be withdrawn\), run:

```bash
panaceacli query distr rewards <delegator_address> <validator_address>
```

#### Query all delegator rewards

To check all current rewards for a delegation \(were they to be withdrawn\), run:

```bash
panaceacli query distr rewards <delegator_address>
```

### Multisig transactions

Multisig transactions require signatures of multiple private keys. Thus, generating and signing a transaction from a multisig account involve cooperation among the parties involved. A multisig transaction can be initiated by any of the key holders, and at least one of them would need to import other parties' public keys into their Keybase and generate a multisig public key in order to finalize and broadcast the transaction.

For example, given a multisig key comprising the keys `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, each of which is held by a distinct party, the user holding `p1` would require to import both `p2` and `p3` in order to generate the multisig account public key:

```text
panaceacli keys add \
  p2 \
  --pubkey=panaceapub1addwnpepqwk3j2j3knuyah89skh8wtn5kr4qx32nhql6hzjadzmre2xlfmvxgy39ln8

panaceacli keys add \
  p3 \
  --pubkey=panaceapub1addwnpepqvr594kcrv7y43l5laqtyxzg7s7f5ma9fvm6gjwsf3pp86j3wln676hwndf

panaceacli keys add \
  p1p2p3 \
  --multisig-threshold=2 \
  --multisig=p1,p2,p3
```

A new multisig public key `p1p2p3` has been stored, and its address will be used as signer of multisig transactions:

```bash
panaceacli keys show --address p1p2p3
```

You may also view multisig threshold, pubkey constituents and respective weights by viewing the JSON output of the key or passing the `--show-multisig` flag:

```bash
panaceacli keys show p1p2p3 -o json

panaceacli keys show p1p2p3 --show-multisig
```

The first step to create a multisig transaction is to initiate it on behalf of the multisig address created above:

```bash
panaceacli tx send panacea1ynkxl2d9yj9hh5jxt3m9s8nljh507tm5u66swq 10umed \
  --from=<multisig_address> \
  --generate-only > unsignedTx.json
```

The file `unsignedTx.json` contains the unsigned transaction encoded in JSON. `p1` can now sign the transaction with its own private key:

```bash
panaceacli tx sign \
  unsignedTx.json \
  --multisig=<multisig_address> \
  --from=p1 \
  --output-document=p1signature.json \
  --chain-id=<chain_id>
```

Once the signature is generated, `p1` transmits both `unsignedTx.json` and `p1signature.json` to `p2` or `p3`, which in turn will generate their respective signature:

```bash
panaceacli tx sign \
  unsignedTx.json \
  --multisig=<multisig_address> \
  --from=p2 \
  --output-document=p2signature.json \
  --chain-id=<chain_id>
```

`p1p2p3` is a 2-of-3 multisig key, therefore one additional signature is sufficient. Any the key holders can now generate the multisig transaction by combining the required signature files:

```bash
panaceacli tx multisign \
  unsignedTx.json \
  p1p2p3 \
  p1signature.json p2signature.json \
  --output-document=signedTx.json \
  --chain-id=<chain_id>
```

The transaction can now be sent to the node:

```bash
panaceacli tx broadcast signedTx.json \
  --chain-id=<chain_id>
```

### Shells completion scripts

Completion scripts for popular UNIX shell interpreters such as `Bash` and `Zsh` can be generated through the `completion` command, which is available for both `panacead` and `panaceacli`.

If you want to generate `Bash` completion scripts run the following command:

```bash
panacead completion > panacead_completion
panaceacli completion > panaceacli_completion
```

If you want to generate `Zsh` completion scripts run the following command:

```bash
panacead completion --zsh > panacead_completion
panaceacli completion --zsh > panaceacli_completion
```

::: tip Note On most UNIX systems, such scripts may be loaded in `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` to enable Bash autocompletion:

```bash
echo '. panacead_completion' >> ~/.bashrc
echo '. panaceacli_completion' >> ~/.bashrc
```

Refer to the user's manual of your interpreter provided by your operating system for information on how to enable shell autocompletion. :::

### AOL

#### Create Topic

You can create topic with this:

```bash
panaceacli tx aol create-topic <topic>
```

#### List Topics

You can query the list of topics belong to specific account:

`panaceacli query aol list-topics <owner_panacea>`

You can get the detail information of the topic with this:

```bash
panaceacli query aol get-topic <owner_panacea> <topic>
```

**Add Writer**

You can add writer to the specific topic.  the list of all validators of a specific chain:

```bash
panaceacli tx aol add-writer <topic> <writer_panacea>
```

::: tip Note that the topic owner is not a writer as default. You need to add your self to the topic as a writer. :::

#### List Writers

You can query the list of writers to the topic:

```bash
panaceacli query aol list-writers <owner_panacea> <topic>
```

You can get the detail information of the writer with this:

```bash
panaceacli query aol get-writer <owner_panacea> <topic> <writer_panacea>
```

where `[name]` is the name of the key you specified when you initialized `panacead`.

While tokens are bonded, they are pooled with all the other bonded tokens in the network. Validators and delegators obtain a percentage of shares that equal their stake in this pool.

#### Delete Writer

Owner can delete writer from the topic. After owner delete the writer, writer can not add record to the topic anymore.

```text
panaceacli tx aol delete-writer <topic> <writer_panacea>
```

::: Note that only owner can delete writer from the topic :::

#### Add Record

Writer can add record to the topic with this:

```bash
panaceacli tx aol add-record <owner_panacea> <topic> <key> <value>
```

#### Get Record

You can query the record with this:

```bash
panaceacli query aol get-record <owner_panacea> <topic> <offset>
```
