## Setting Up a New Node

These instructions are for setting up a brand new full node from scratch.

First, initialize the node and create the necessary config files:

```bash
panacead init <your_custom_moniker>
```

::: warning Note Monikers can contain only ASCII characters. Using Unicode characters will render your node unreachable. :::

You can edit this `moniker` later, in the `~/.panacead/config/config.toml` file:

```text
# A custom human readable name for this node
moniker = "<your_custom_moniker>"
```

You can edit the `~/.panacead/config/panacead.toml` file in order to enable the anti spam mechanism and reject incoming transactions with less than a minimum fee:

```text
# This is a TOML config file.
# For more information, see https://github.com/toml-lang/toml

##### main base config options #####

# Validators reject any tx from the mempool with less than the minimum fee per gas.
minimum_fees = ""
```

Your full node has been initialized!

## Genesis & Seeds

### Copy the Genesis File

Fetch the [`genesis.json`](https://github.com/medibloc/panacea-launch/blob/master/genesis.json) file into `~/.panacead/config/genesis.json`  file.

To verify the correctness of the configuration run:

```bash
panacead start
```

### Add Seed Nodes

Your node needs to know how to find peers. You'll need to add healthy seed nodes to `$HOME/.panacead/config/config.toml`. 

Mainnet seed nodes are described below.

```text
8c41cc8a6fc59f05138ae6c16a9eec05d601ef71@13.209.177.91
cc0285c4d9cec8489f8bfed0a749dd8636406a0d@54.180.169.37
1fc4a41660986ee22106445b67444ec094221e76@52.78.132.151
```

Insert those `<node_id>@<ip>`s with 26656 port to the `persistent_peers` field in `config.toml` file.

```text
# Comma separated list of nodes to keep persistent connections to
persistent_peers = "8c41cc8a6fc59f05138ae6c16a9eec05d601ef71@13.209.177.91:26656,cc0285c4d9cec8489f8bfed0a749dd8636406a0d@54.180.169.37:26656,1fc4a41660986ee22106445b67444ec094221e76@52.78.132.151:26656"
```

For more information on seeds and peers, you can [read this](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/develop/docs/tendermint-core/using-tendermint.md#peers).

## Run a Full Node

Start the full node with this command:

```bash
panacead start
```

Check that everything is running smoothly:

```bash
panaceacli status
```

View the status of the network with the [Block Explorer](https://explorer.medibloc.org).

## Export State

Panacea can dump the entire application state to a JSON file, which could be useful for manual analysis and can also be used as the genesis file of a new network.

Export state with:

```bash
panacead export > [filename].json
```

You can also export state from a particular height \(at the end of processing the block of that height\):

```bash
panacead export --height [height] > [filename].json
```
