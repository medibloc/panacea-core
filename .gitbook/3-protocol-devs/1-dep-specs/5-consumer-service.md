## Synopsis

This document describes consumer service.

### Motivation
Data consumers should run an HTTP server to receive the encrypted data from oracle.
When creating deals, data consumers must specify the endpoint of their server in the `consumer-service-endpoint` field.

When the incentive is paid to the data provider completely, the data consumer can get the `secret key` to decrypt data received from the oracle.

### Definitions
- `Data Provider`, `Data Consumer`, and `Oracle` are defined in [User Flow](./1-user-flow.md)
- `Deal` is defined in [Data Deal](./2-data-deal.md)
- `Consumer Service`: HTTP server to store data provided by oracle

## Technical Specification

### Consumer service specification
The consumer service must be able to handle the HTTP POST request below:

#### Request URI
```http request
POST /v0/deals/${dealId}/data/${dataHash}
```

#### Request Headers
```
# Authorization: Bearer {jwtToken}
# Content-Type: application/json
```

The JWT is signed by oracle using the oracle private key.
The `consumer service` can use this JWT to authenticate that oracle sent the POST request.

## Backwards Compatibility
