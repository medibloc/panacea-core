## Synopsis

This document explains why the oracles must use confidential computing.

## Motivation

In DEP, the data must be verified as explained in the [data validation documentation](./4-data-validation.md).
Verifying data means that the content of the data could be shown to the oracle. However, no one would want their data to be
exposed to the oracle for data verification. There may also be malicious oracles that exploit the data unfairly. To
prevent this, we have designed the oracle in DEP with confidential computing. Confidential computing guarantees that only
selected code (binary) can access data in the secure enclave. Also, it could protect a sensitive data from being leaked 
by malicious operators while verifying the data correctly in this decentralized system.

## Confidential Oracle

Without confidential computing, the oracle operators(human) could see the content of sensitive data. 
For example, if the oracle software stores important sensitive data to the disk or storage without sealing it, 
it can be read by anyone who can access the disk or the storage. 
So we developed the confidential oracle for preventing the case from the malicious oracle by using below sections.

### Technical Specification

For confidential computing environment, we chose Intel SGX, which offers hardware-based memory
encryption for data security, using [Microsoft Azure Confidential Computing VM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/confidential-computing/overview).
Also, we chose [EGo](https://www.edgeless.systems/products/ego/) SDK, which enables the development of confidential apps
written in Go language.

### Oracle Key

The oracle key is an asymmetric key that should be shared across all oracles. The request from a data provider and a data consumer that
an oracle receives must be encrypted by the oracle public key. If the secure data encryption and decryption need to be
performed, the corresponding the oracle private key must be held by every oracle securely. How all oracles share the oracle
private key and how they store this key securely will be described in the next section.

### Oracle Key Handshake

The oracle private key is sealed by a unique ID, which is derived from the Intel SGX enclave. 

If an oracle operator modifies the source code of the oracle, this unique ID will be changed. 
If a malicious oracle operator modifies the source code of the oracle to print logs of sensitive data or to leak the data to somewhere else, it could cause a serious privacy problems. 

This means that the all oracle operators must only use the genuine binary built by selected code.
Only the genuine binary can unseal the data in the SGX secure enclave.
"Rewrite this section"
If the oracle wants to register, it must use remote report composed of the promised security version and unique ID.
So the one of the oracle approves the registration if the new oracle's remote report is valid.
If you want a register the oracle, you can verify remote report that is valid or not using
[CLI](../../5-oracles/7-verfiy-remote-report.md). After the oracle registration passed, the new oracle can retrieve the shared oracle
private key.

### Sealing Secrets and States

All secrets and important information, such as the shared oracle private key and the state of blockchain light client,
must be sealed before it is stored to the disk, so that anyone outside the enclave cannot read it. The sealing must be
done with the unique ID of the enclave, so that any modified enclave cannot unseal secrets.

So how to we set a correct unique ID and how to know it is not malicious binary? The correct unique ID will be
determined by Panacea governance. We can know the correct unique ID from Panacea as Single Source of Truth(SSOT),
and know that what the correct genuine binary is.
