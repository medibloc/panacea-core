# Consume data

Data consumers can open data deals by specifying the type, the quantity, and the pricing of the data that they are willing to consume. 

Data deals are registered in the Panacea public blockchain, so all data providers can find data deals, which match their data.


## Create a data deal

Broadcast the following `create-deal` transaction with count and budget specified in the deal-file in JSON format.
The deal-file should contain information of json `data schema` or `presentation definition`.

```bash
panacead tx datadeal create-deal ${deal-file-path} \
  --from ${data-consumer-addr} \
  --chain-id ${chain-id} \
  --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.30 --gas-prices 5umed \
  --node ${chain-node-rpc-addr}
```

For `deal-file-path`, create a following JSON file.
```json
{
  "data_schema": [
    "http://jsonschema.gopanacea.org/vaccination-cert.json"
  ],
  "budget": {
    "denom": "umed",
    "amount": "1000000"
  },
  "max_num_data": 10,
  "consumer_address": "panacea1...",
  "agreement_terms": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "required": true,
      "title": "Terms of data provision",
      "description": "The provided data will be used for ..."
    }
  ],
  "presentation_definition": "<Base64-encoded byte array>",
  "consumer_service_endpoint": "https://consumer.example.com",
}
```
When `data_schema` is set, oracle performs [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/) validation, and when `presentation_definition` is set, oracle performs [verifiable presentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#presentations-0) based validation.
For more details about data deals, please see the [Data Deal](../../3-protocol-devs/1-dep-specs/2-data-deal.md) specification.

**Consumer Service**

You(data consumer) must run a `consumer service` to receive and store encrypted data from oracle.

The `consumer service` must be able to handle HTTP POST request like below:
```bash
curl -v -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer ${jwt}" \
  -d "@<encrypted-data-path>" \
  "${consumer-service-endpoint}/v0/deals/${dealId}/data/${dataHash}
```
You can receive encrypted data from oracle via your consumer service, but the decryption key (so called `secret key`) can obtained from oracle only after the data provider submits consents to the Panacea blockchain and the incentive is paid to the provider completely.

For more details about `consumer service`, please see the [Consumer Service](../../3-protocol-devs/1-dep-specs/5-consumer-service.md) specification.

## Query deals

One can query a deal with its deal ID.
```bash
panacead query datadeal deal ${deal-id} \
  --node ${chain-node-rpc-addr}
```
One can also query all deals registered in the chain.
```bash
panacead query datadeal deals \
  --node ${chain-node-rpc-addr}
```


## Query consents

If some data providers have data that fit the requirements of your (data consumers') data deal, they will submit consents to the chain.
The `consent` means that the data provider has agreed to provide their data to a specific data consumer.
Also, each `consent` should contain a data validation `certificate` issued by an oracle, so that data consumers can trust the validity of data.

As soon as data providers submit their consents, you (data consumer) can query all consents submitted to a specific data deal.
```bash
panacead query datadeal consents ${deal-id} \
  --node ${chain-node-rpc-addr}
```
Or, you can query a specific consent, which contains a certain data hash.
```bash
panacead query datadeal consent ${deal-id} ${data-hash} \
  --node ${chain-node-rpc-addr}
```

For more details about data consents, please see the [Data Provider Consent](../../3-protocol-devs/1-dep-specs/3-data-provider-consent.md) specification.


## Access data

Oracle issues a validated `certificate` and sends encrypted data to the `consumer service` with HTTP POST request based on the `consumer_service_endpoint` in the deal.

In general, the data transmitted is encrypted by oracles, so that only a specific data consumer is able to decrypt it.
Using the following REST API, you can get a `secret key` of each data from any registered oracles.
```bash
curl -v -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer ${jwt}" \
  "${oracle-url}/v0/data-deal/secret-key?deal-id=${deal-id}&data-hash=${data-hash}"
```
You must specify a JWT issued using your account key in order to prove that you are the data consumer who created the data deal.
For this authentication, the JWT must be signed by your (data consumer's) chain account private key.

We highly recommend to set the expiration of JWT as short as possible for security reasons.
You can use the `panacead` CLI to issue JWTs easily by the following command.
In near future, the protocol will adopt the 'nonce' concept to improve the security of authentications.
```bash
panacead issue-jwt ${expiration-duration} --from ${your-account-key-name}

# e.g.
# panacead issue-jwt 10s --from panacea1zqum...
```

Please note that the returned secret key is also encrypted, so that only the specific data consumers can decrypt the key using his/her chain account private key.
Nevertheless, we highly recommend you to communicate with oracles who provide an HTTPS endpoint with SSL/TLS encryption.

Using the encrypted secret key that you obtained from the oracle, you can decrypt data by the following CLI.
```bash
panacead decrypt-data ${input-file-path} ${your-account-key-name} ${encrypted-secret-key} \
  --node ${chain-node-rpc-addr}
```
This command will decrypt the `secret key` using your account key first, and decrypt the data using the decrypted `secret key`.
So, please note that you should specify the `your-account-key-name` which is registered in the `panacead` keyring.
