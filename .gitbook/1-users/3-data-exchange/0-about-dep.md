# About Data Exchange Protocol

Data Exchange Protocol (hereafter 'DEP') is a communication layer for sharing and exchanging various types of data
between two parties in decentralized environments.


## What can you do with DEP?

Data consumers can open data deals by specifying the type, the quantity, and the pricing of the data that they are willing to consume. 

Data providers can choose and participate in the deals that match the data that they have when they are willing to provide.

To guarantee data consumers can only consume data in the form they want,
decentralized oracles verify and issue certificates for all data being shared

Panacea public blockchain manages the status of all data deals and data sharing consents,
ensuring data providers and ecosystem operators are rewarded appropriately.


## Motivation and Goals

### Data Ownership and Sovereignty

The ultimate goal of owning our own data is having a control about how our data is used.

### Decentralized off-chain data validation

To ensure data consumers can only consume data that they want, all data being shared must be validated by
decentralized players who are not malicious.

### Privacy

Throughout the entire process of data verification and transmission,
the data content must not be exposed to anyone other than the consumer intended by the data provider.

### Generalized data exchange

Not only healthcare data, but various types of data should be covered through this protocol.

### Open-sourced protocol

All protocol specifications and implementations must be open-sourced, so any participants can understand
how data is exchanged and how privacy is guaranteed.
